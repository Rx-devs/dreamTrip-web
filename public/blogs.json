    "description": "Antibes is home to some of the region’s most luxurious villas, yachts, and establishments — but beneath this glitz and glamor is a charming old town with 16th-century ramparts and cobblestone streets that even caught the eye of personalities like Picasso (he has featured Antibes in his paintings many times and you will find a museum for him in town).If you’re more for music, the yearly Jazz à Juan is a 9-day affair that’s not to be missed!",

    "description": "Rurikarakusa is a low-growing plant that has pretty baby blue flowers — which often makes it gain the name ‘baby blue eyes’. It helps to note that this is part of the nemophila genus group of flowers; however, this particular kind refers to the ‘insignis blue’ variety. So if you’re in TOKYO, you can head over to the Showa Memorial Park near Tachikawa Station to view this blue beauty. Otherwise, head north to see the Instagrammable view shown in the photo above called as… Hitachi Seaside Park: This is a well-known park that is loved for its seasonal flowers throughout the year, but it is mostly visited in spring because of its sea of blue nemophila that number over 4 million!!! It is absolutely densely covered that it will seem like you’re walking in the sky.",

The name Camogli actually means ‘house of wives‘ due to the fact that in the olden times, the women ‘ruled’ the town while the husbands are busy working at sea. If you come around the 2nd weekend of May, you will witness the town celebrating its maritime heritage — and if you go to the waterfront, you’ll even get to see them fry hundreds of fish in 3-meter wide pans!",

As a part of your French Riviera road trip, Cannes offers picturesque natural sceneries on its harbor and offshore islands. Don’t miss out as well on the old town, Le Suquet, and its pristine beaches especially during the summer.",

One of the highlights in this place that is mainly visited by tourists is the structure at a top of a cliff that is an imitation of the Acropolis of Athens in Greece (as seen in the photo above).",

Don’t forget to visit the medieval fortress as well as the Jardin Exotique cactus garden on top of the village because it’s where you’ll get grand panoramic vista views over Eze!",

As a part of the Cinque Terre National Park, the area has also been lauded as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997 thereby making it a favorite among tourists who seek an unforgettable staycation — if not spend days of hiking. Though cars are banned between the villages, a well-connected 19th-century railway cuts through the mountains to connect one village to another, namely: Monterosso al Mare,Vernazza,Corniglia,Manarola,Riomaggiore",

    "description": "Plum blossoms or ume are actually the first to bloom among the spring flowers in Japan, so it is often referred to as a sign of how spring has arrived. As such, flower viewing or hanami was first done for plum flowers, not the sakura; not to mention that plum blossoms even last longer for about a month, as compared to sakura that only lasts about 7 to 10 days. Try not to mistake this for sakura (since they do look somewhat alike) and enjoy its beauty in the following spots… (ATAMI) Atami Baien Plum Festival: This is one of the best plum viewing spots in Japan given that the trees are one of the earliest kinds to bloom (around 2nd week of January). There are about 400 plum trees here and during the festival, you’ll get to see some performances too! (TOKYO) Bunkyo Plum Blossom Festival: Held in Yushima Tenmangu shrine, this is one of the most famous flower events in the capital and you’ll find over 300 plum trees spread about inside the shrine.",

Apart from Huma, there is also another island in Palawan that can compare to the beauty and ambiance of the Maldives: Amanpulo in Pamalican Island. As such, it should really be clear that with the abundance of islands in the Philippines, we can have just about every kind of island getaway that there can be.",

They are such tiny five-petaled flowers that grow quite close, that’s why when they are planted in great numbers, the scenery will seemingly look like it has formed a natural carpet. The best places to go to in order to see the moss phlox or shibazakura in its full glory would be… Fuji Shibazakura Festival: (Pictured above) This takes place every year in Fuji Motosuko Resort, a flower park in the Yamanashi Prefecture that’s close to Mt. Fuji and located somewhere south of Lake Motosuko in the Five Fuji Lakes area. The extensive field of shibazakura flowers here is one of the largest in the greater Tokyo area, embracing about 1 million shibazakura in different colors! You’ll love how the flowers roll out endlessly in lawns of blushing red, pink, creamy white, as well as a touch of purple, and in these carpeted fields, there is nothing obstructing your view of Mt. Fuji (especially on a clear day!). Hitsujiyama Park: An alternative would be this spot in Chichibu that’s closer to Tokyo. Albeit smaller than the former, this scenic park still boasts about 400,000 shibazakura for you to enjoy!",
